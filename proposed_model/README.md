## Description of notebooks
This repository contains the code implementation of our proposed model and the results for different datasets. A brief summary of all notebooks is given below. 

- Proposed_CD_Model_Applied_On_Sea_Ice_Data.ipynb: The proposed method is applied to Arctic Sea Ice data in this notebook.
- Proposed_CD_Model_Applied_On_TKE_Data.ipynb: The proposed method is applied to the Turbulence Kinetic Energy (TKE) dataset in this notebook.
- Proposed_CD_Model_Applied_On_FMRI_Data.ipynb: The proposed method is applied to the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) dataset in this notebook.
- Proposed_CD_Model_Applied_On_Synthetic_Dataset_1.ipynb: The proposed model is applied to the synthetic dataset with seasonal-like features in this notebook.
- Proposed_CD_Model_Applied_On_Synthetic_Dataset_2.ipynb: In this notebook, we applied the proposed model to the 2nd 
 version of the synthetic dataset without seasonal-like features.
- Proposed_CD_Model_Applied_On_Synthetic_Dataset_3.ipynb: In this notebook, we applied the proposed model to the 3rdd 
 version of the synthetic dataset.
